# Automatic-Text-Message-Reminder


Project has been fully designed, developed, tested, and has even received funding from Twilio!

Impact: Program can send an automatic text message reminder to anyone who scans a specified QR code. The objective is to increase student participation in the CS Club by sending out automated reminders for meetings and events. Over hundreds of text messages can be sent out simultaneously by running the program.

How to use:
1. Install Python / Twilio APIs (as mentioned in code file).
2. Create a Google form (like the one shown by scanning the example QR code), and link it to a spreadsheet.
3. Get the spreadsheet ID, and paste in the specified location in the code file.
4. Get your Twilio SID & authorization token and paste them in the specified locations, respectively.
5. Run the program! (If there are no names/numbers in the spreadsheet, no messages will be sent).
