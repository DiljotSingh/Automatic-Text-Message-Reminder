# Google-Forms-Text-Reminder


Project has been fully designed, developed, and tested, just undergoing authorization by Twilio!

Impact: Program can send an automatic text message reminder to anyone who scans a specified QR code. I developed this to increase engagement in my university's Computer Science Club's upcoming election and boost membership numbers. Corresponding technology will be distributed across campus.
